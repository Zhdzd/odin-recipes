# odin-recipes

Project done as part of ODIN PROJECT as a refresher to practice my basic html skills 
- anchor tags used to link to different web pages 
- unordered and ordered lists used for ingredients and recipe steps
- image tags used to insert image of recipes

At the time of writing, no CSS has been implemented yet due to following of ODIN PROJECT Curriculum.
Will revisit project to enhance design of web page.

Cheers!

** Update **
- Basic CSS added to webpage 
- External CSS method used
- Practiced CSS using classes 
- Explored different styles for images 
- incorporated divs
